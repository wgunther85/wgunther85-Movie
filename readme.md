# Git Basics

We will be using git and github to manage our source code in this class.
git is a version control system commonly used in industry and is a tool
that employers are constantly asking for.  This assignment will help you
become familiar with the basics of using git and github.

C++ has two common ways to represent strings, the string class or a char buffer
(commonly called c-strings). In this assignment we will write a function that
counts the number of characters in a c-string.

## Goals:
The purpose of this project is to become familiar with the git version control
system.  It will also provide a brief review of c++ functions, arrays, and loops.

## Requirements:

1. Github basics

+ Checkout your assignment from the github repository.
+ Get your project setup in your chosen IDE.
+ Implement the myStringLen function.
+ Compile and test your code.
+ Commit the changes and push to github.

Starter code is provided and you will need to modify the StringFunctions.cpp and
StringFunctions.h files.
The StringFunctionsTest.cpp driver file does not need to be edited and
any changes you make to it should not be included in your final submission.
However, many students find it useful to add their own test cases or comment out
certain sections while developing their code.
This is completely acceptable but remember any changes you make to the
StringFunctionsTest.cpp file will not be used when grading your assignment.


## Tips and suggestions:
- C-strings always end with the null character.  Loop through the string counting characters until you reach the null character.
- Get started early. Download and install git today.  Clone the repository and build the executable.
- Always get the latest changes before starting any new work.  This will make it easier to merge your changes back.
- Build the executable on both Windows and Linux.  Make sure you know how to use the tools.
- Look at the driver file. Just because you will not be making changes to that code, you should still understand what it is doing. The tests are examples of expected results for each of the different methods. If you want to know what concat is supposed to do, look at the input and expected output.
- Read the comments in the header files.  They describe what each method is meant to do.
- Use the debugger.  When you are getting unexpected results, set a breakpoint and trace exactly what is happening in the code.
- Ask for help.  Use the tutors, canvas dicussion boards and me.  Be detailed and descriptive of what problem you are having and how you have tried to solve it. When you ask me for help make sure your latest code is in your git repository.
